# t

A simple task manager for people who want to complete tasks, not organize them.  

    TODO show introductory asciinema

#### Simple, Effective & Extensible

**t**'s simplicity is its strength. You can easily integrate it with other tools for fun little features:

1. use it in version control tools: `sha1`ed keys mean you are very unlikely to get conflicts
2. bash prompt
3. show tasks in your editor
4. show tasks in statusbar

#### Why rewrite sjl/t?

To add some features and practice Go while staying faithful to original philosophy of keeping it simple.

*Also rewrite of [sjl/t](http://github.com/sjl/t) in Go with improvements*

#### To Contribute

The planned featureset is in the `tasks` file; choose one or suggest a feature of your own.

The codebase is easy to develop new features on top of but `t` is meant to be simple. If you are seeking something more powerful, is [TaskWarrior](http://github.com) or [todo.txt](http://github.com) might suit you better.
